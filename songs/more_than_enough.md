## Verse 1
Maybe I'll never know the love it takes  
To make me a happy home that's warm and safe  
And maybe I'll never see how you pray for my every need  
And wonder what more you could do for me  

But when you *walk* by my side  
*Read* me stories at night  
And teach me to trust in God's love  
You give me a hug, maybe two  
And you say, "I love you"  
Then I think you're *doing* enough  

## Verse 2
Maybe you wonder if you're teaching me  
Every good thing that I can someday be  
But all that I know of faith  
And of kindness and love and strength  
I've learned just by watching you every day  

So when you *stay* by my side  
*Hear* me stories at night  
And teach me to trust in God's love  
You give me a hug, maybe two  
And you say, "I love you"  
Then I think you're *doing* enough  

## Verse 3
Someday, I'll have a home, a family  
And I'll love them just as much as you love me  
Then maybe you'll finally see  
You have given enough for me  
A gift that will last through eternity  

So when you *stay* by my side  
*Hear* my stories at night  
And teach me to trust in God's love  
You give me a hug, maybe two  
And you say, "I love you"  
Then I think you're *more than* enough  

## Ending
And I'm blessed every step by your love
