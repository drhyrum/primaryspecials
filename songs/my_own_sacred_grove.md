# Verse 1
Joseph Smith went to a grove full of trees  
Seeking God's wisdom, he fell to his knees  
As he pled with the heavens, the sky filled with light  
And the Father appeared with His Son Jesus Christ  
Standing above in the air  
Coming to answer his prayer  

I will find my own sacred grove  
Away from all of the noise of the world  
I will turn to prayer  
For I know He's there  
I will find my own sacred grove  

## Verse 2
So many choices with so much at stake  
Life's full of pathways, but which should I take?  
If I lift up in prayer in the name of the Son  
Through the power of the Holy Ghost, answers will come  
Heavenly Father is there  
Ready to answer my prayer  

I will find my own sacred grove  
Away from all of the noise of the world  
I will turn to prayer  
For I know He's there  
I will find my own sacred grove  

## Bridge
Sometimes the answers take time  
So I'll listen in heart and mind  
Revelation will come my way  
As I wait patiently in faith  

I will find my own sacred grove  
Away from all of the noise of the world  
I will turn to prayer  
For I know He's there  
I will find my own sacred grove  

I will find my own sacred grove
