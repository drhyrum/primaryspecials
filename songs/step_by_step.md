## Verse 1
My faith in Jesus Christ  
Has led me here today.  
Yes, I’ll be baptized just like him  
Whose life showed me the way.  

Step by step, step by step,  
I’ll follow Jesus Christ.  
Step by step, step by step,  
He leads me with his light.  
If I stumble, if I fall,  
His love will lead me back.  
Step by step, I’ll walk with him  
Along my covenant path.  

## Verse 2
I’ll hear the gentle words,  
“Receive the Holy Ghost.”  
He’ll comfort me and guide my way—  
A gift I’ll treasure most.  

Step by step, step by step,  
I’ll follow Jesus Christ.  
Step by step, step by step,  
He leads me with his light.  
If I stumble, if I fall,  
His love will lead me back.  
Step by step, I’ll walk with him  
Along my covenant path.  

## Verse 3
Each week I have the chance  
To take the sacrament,  
Renewing sacred promises  
And choosing to repent.

Step by step, step by step,  
I’ll follow Jesus Christ.  
Step by step, step by step,  
He leads me with his light.  
If I stumble, if I fall,  
His love will lead me back.  
Step by step, I’ll walk with him  
Along my covenant path.
