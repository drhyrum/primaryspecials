# I Know That My Savior Loves Me

## Verse 1
A long time ago in a beautiful place, Children were gathered 'round Jesus.  
He blessed and taught as they felt of His love.  
Euch saw the tears on His face.  
The love that He felt for His little ones I know He feels for me.  
I did not touch Him or sit on His knee,  
Yet, Jesus is real to me.  

I know He lives!  
I will follow faithfully.  
My heart I give to Him.  
I know that my Savior loves me.  

## Verse 2
Now I am here in a beautiful place, Learning the teachings of Jesus.  
Parents and teachers will help guide the way, Lighting my path ev'ry day.  
Wrapped in the arms of my Savior's love, I feel His gentle touch.  
Living each day, I will follow His way, Home to my Father above.  

I know He lives!  
I will follow faithfully.  
My heart I give to Him.  
I know that my Savior loves me.  

I know that my Savior loves me.
