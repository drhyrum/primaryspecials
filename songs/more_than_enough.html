<h1>Lyrics</h1>
<br/>1.Maybe I'll never know the love it takes
<br/>To make me a happy home that's warm and safe
<br/>And maybe I'll never see how you pray for my every need
<br/>And wonder what more you could do for me
<br/>
<br/>But when you walk by my side
<br/>Read me stories at night
<br/>And teach me to trust in God's love
<br/>You give me a hug, maybe two
<br/>And you say, "I love you"
<br/>Then I think you're doing enough
<br/>
<br/>2. Maybe you wonder if you're teaching me
<br/>Every good thing that I can someday be
<br/>But all that I know of faith
<br/>And of kindness and love and strength
<br/>I've learned just by watching you every day
<br/>
<br/>So when you stay by my side
<br/>Hear me stories at night
<br/>And teach me to trust in God's love
<br/>You give me a hug, maybe two
<br/>And you say, "I love you"
<br/>Then I think you're doing enough
<br/>
<br/>3. Someday, I'll have a home, a family
<br/>And I'll love them just as much as you love me
<br/>Then maybe you'll finally see
<br/>You have given enough for me
<br/>A gift that will last through eternity
<br/>
<br/>So when you stay by my side
<br/>Hear my stories at night
<br/>And teach me to trust in God's love
<br/>You give me a hug, maybe two
<br/>And you say, "I love you"
<br/>Then I think you're more than enough
<br/>
<br/>And I'm blessed every step by your love
