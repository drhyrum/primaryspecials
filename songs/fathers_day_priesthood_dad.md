words taken with slight modification from [My Dad](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/music/library/childrens-songbook/my-dad?lang=eng)_   

## Verse 1
My dad's my favorite pal.  
I help him every day.  
It's plain to see I want to be  
Like him in every way.

## Verse 2
He teaches honesty.  
Is best in all I do.
I'm very glad that he's my dad.  
I know he loves me, too.  


## Sacrament presentation
To the piano playing "My Dad", a senior primary child reads:

Parents have a sacred duty to rear their children in love and righteousness, to provide for their physical and spiritual needs, and to teach them to love and serve one another, observe the commandments of God, and be law-abiding citizens wherever they live. 

By divine design, fathers are to preside over their families in love and righteousness and are responsible to provide the necessities of life and protection for their families.
