# The Miracle
[watch on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ES4_29QwKpI)

## Verse 1
Jesus walked upon the water  
He stilled the storm and calmed the angry sea  
With His hands He healed the leper  
He made the lame to walk, the blind to see  
He fed a thousand people with a loaf or two of bread  
And when the ruler's daughter died  
He raised her from the dead  

Jesus is a God of miracles  
Nothing is at all impossible to Him  
But I know this  
Of all His miracles, the most incredible must be  
The miracle that rescues me  

## Verse 2
Jesus bled and died to save me  
A price that I could never pay alone  
When He rose again, He gave me  
The greatest gift the world has ever known  
Yes, I can be forgiven every time that I repent  
And someday He will lift me up to live with Him again  

Jesus is a God of miracles  
Nothing is at all impossible to Him  
But I know this:  
Of all His miracles the most incredible must be  
The miracle that rescues me  

The miracle that rescues you and me
