[watch on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VYI2Y1voMw)

## Verse 1
Jesus climbed the hill to the garden still.  
His steps were heavy and slow.  
Love and a prayer took Him there  
To the place only He could go.  

Gethsemane. Jesus loves me,  
So He went willingly to Gethsemane.  

## Verse 2
He felt all that was sad, wicked, or bad,  
All the pain we would ever know.  
While His friends were asleep, He fought to keep  
His promise made long ago.  

Gethsemane. Jesus loves me,  
So He went willingly to Gethsemane.  

## Bridge
The hardest thing that ever was done,  
The greatest pain that ever was known,  
The biggest battle that ever was wonâ€”  
This was done by Jesus!  
The fight was won by Jesus!  

Gethsemane. Jesus loves me,  
So He _gave_ His gift to me _in_ Gethsemane.  

Gethsemane. Jesus loves me,  
So He _gives_ His gift to me _from_ Gethsemane.
