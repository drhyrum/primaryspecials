## Verse 1
One, for each blessed day  
Two, every breath I take  
Three, for my family  
Four, all they mean to me  
Five, just to be alive  
Six, for the earth and sky  
And seven for heaven  
For every good thing that I have comes from God  
Every day, every hour  
There are blessings He sends without number or end  
If I counted a hundred or a thousand, I'm sure  
There would still be more to be thankful for  

## Verse 2
Eight, for the chance to grow  
Nine, heart and hands and soul  
Ten, for the eyes to see  
All God has given me  
I could go on and on  
Counting the whole day long  
I know He is with me  
For every good thing that I have comes from God  
Every day, every hour  
There are blessings He sends without number or end  
If I counted a hundred or a thousand, I'm sure  
There would still be more  
There would still be more  
And more  
to be thankful for.
