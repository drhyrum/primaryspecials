# Lyrics

1. Maybe I'll never know the love it takes
To make me a happy home that's warm and safe
And maybe I'll never see how you pray for my every need
And wonder what more you could do for me

But when you *walk* by my side
*Read* me stories at night
And teach me to trust in God's love
You give me a hug, maybe two
And you say, "I love you"
Then I think you're *doing* enough

2. Maybe you wonder if you're teaching me
Every good thing that I can someday be
But all that I know of faith
And of kindness and love and strength
I've learned just by watching you every day

So when you *stay* by my side
*Hear* me stories at night
And teach me to trust in God's love
You give me a hug, maybe two
And you say, "I love you"
Then I think you're *doing* enough

3. Someday, I'll have a home, a family
And I'll love them just as much as you love me
Then maybe you'll finally see
You have given enough for me
A gift that will last through eternity

So when you *stay* by my side
*Hear* my stories at night
And teach me to trust in God's love
You give me a hug, maybe two
And you say, "I love you"
Then I think you're *more than* enough

And I'm blessed every step by your love
